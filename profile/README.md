## Hi there 👋

I’m Daniel J. Manning — a **Full-Stack Web Developer** passionate about crafting fast, secure, and beautiful web experiences.

I build with UI and UX at the core, ensuring every design feels natural, intuitive, and human-focused.
On the backend, I reinforce every layer with robust application security — including AES-256 encryption, session management, and encryption at rest — so performance and protection go hand in hand.
